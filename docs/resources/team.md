I have a background in geography, and over a decade of experience developing methods and workflows to map different environmental variables at large spatial and temporal scales (e.g. fire dynamics, land cover, ecosystems) across multiple professional experiences in Portugal, Italy, and Germany. Now, as am a member of the lab of Agroecological Modeling at the University of Bonn, I am engaged in biodiversity monitoring using big data, including remote sensing, camera traps and audio recordings. I am particularly interested in using biodiversity data for purposes other that conservations, such as using species as environmental sensors, a topic I am pursuing in the scope of the BioViewPoint project.
